# Cybersecurity UX Project

This project showcases a user centered approach to cybersecurity risk analysis and system hardening using Kali Linux tools.

## Overview

I conducted a vulnerability and risk assessment on a fictional company server called **Synth Wave Productions** using Kali Linux tools like `Nmap`, `Lynis`, and manual system analysis.

## Objectives

- Identify system vulnerabilities using industry standard tools.
- Evaluate risk levels using the NIST SP 800-30 framework.
- Translate complex findings into UX friendly summaries and recommendations.
- Deliver documentation and visuals suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Lynis
- NIST SP 800-30 Framework

## Key Deliverables

- Vulnerability findings with annotated screenshots
- UX focused risk summary table
- Corrective Action Plan
